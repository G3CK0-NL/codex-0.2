The tool runs on all platforms having the above Java version (or newer).

**Debian/Ubuntu/Kali users**
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre
```

**Windows users**

[Get JRE v7 (or newer) from the java.com website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/).

# Installation
No installation is needed (this is a portable tool). Just download the zip:
```sh
$ wget https://github.com/G3CK0-NL/codex-0.2/archive/master.zip
```
Or use git:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/G3CK0-NL/codex-0.2.git
```
Be sure to verify the integrity of the jar using a sha sum:
```sh
sha512: d4e3c27b93f4f9fc79b507b4ed5aab7026839de09f94f70186b7de088656dc9e19c3b9b180035c81b1fd83177fd204fe86e27a41f9432d3ef8533d835c0c42d2

sha1:   c6edf4c1b8621f975e3efeaa17590f062a36327c
```

# Usage
Start through GUI: Doubleclick!
Start through CLI: 
```sh
$ java -jar codex.jar
```

Examples to send text/data to the tool through the CLI:
```sh
$ cat /etc/passwd | java -jar codex.jar
$ java -jar codex.jar /etc/passwd
$ java -jar codex.jar < /etc/passwd
```
You can also send the generated result/output of the tool (right pane) to stdout. This enables command-line passing, for example:
```sh
$ cat /etc/passwd | java -jar codex.jar > somedumpfile.txt
$ cat /etc/passwd | java -jar codex.jar | sort -u | head
```

# Changes in version 0.2 
## New functionality
The following functionality is added in this version: 
- Added the following new conversions:
    - Gray code
    - Morse
    - Unicode (2 byte) text strings (encoding only, for now)
- Added the following new encryptions:
    - Atbash (rot-0 reversed alphabet) quick setting in rot encryption tab
- Added the "Text" tab. The codex is now packing a complete array of text manipulation options:
    - Search - Grep through text
    - Replace - Replace text with different text
    - Extract - Extract a substring from a string. This can be done in multiple ways:
        - By column (using some seperator and a column number)
        - By two separators
        - By character index (start/end/length)
    - Sort - Sort lines of text (or words) alphabetically. You can also sort unique occurrences (and obtain the counts).
    - Delimiter - This transcoder makes it possible to add, change and remove text delimiters (for example in CSV formats).
    - Multiple utilities:
        - Make uppercase or lowercase
        - Reverse text
        - Delete empty lines
        - Trim text
        - Modify newlines (DOS vs Linux vs none)
- Added the "Web" tab. This adds the following functionality: 
    - URLencoding and -decoding (replaces characters like & ? + and space)
    - To/from HTML characters (replaces characters with their &#..; equivalent)
    - Encode string to javascript fromCharCode() function
    - Strip XML/HTML tags
- Added the "Generate" tab. You can now generate: 
    - Ranges of numbers
    - Random numbers
    - Ranges of characters (by ASCII value)
    - Random characters (based on candidate text)
    - Text based on custom text (create NOP-sleds, etc)
    - Lorem Ipsum placeholder text
- Added the following interactive listings and tools to the upper toolbar: 
    - ASCII table. Table is searchable and copies values to clipboard on doubleclick and right mouse click
    - Network port list. This list contains over 9000 ports, listing both formal and malware use (based on SANS lising)
    - Well-known extension list
    - MAC address vendor list
    - Color chooser

## New application features
The following application features are added in this version:
- Add line numbers to the text areas
- Added zooming capability (Ctrl-scroll / Ctrl + / Ctrl - / Ctrl 0) to the text areas.
- You can now pipe data to the application like:
    cat /etc/passwd | java -jar codex.jar
- You can input data to the application like:
    java -jar codex.jar < /etc/passwd
- Clear function added to toolbar.
- Upon exit (with data in output screen) the save options are changed: "output to stderr" is replaced with "output to clipboard".
- Option "paste over all" added to textfield context menu.
- Added application icon ;)
- Added tooltips in: mainframe, panels: convert, encoding-base, encoding-uu, hash, generate, crypt-rot, crypt-xor, text-search, text-replace, text-extract, text-sort, text-delimiter.
- Moved word-wrap option to context menu.
- Added about box, containing lots of information about the tool.
- Added context menu for accessing the about box and changing loglevels.

## Bugfixes
The following bugs are fixed in this version: 
- Converter > From Hex: selecting a period as seperator results in an empty output, instead of correctly decoded output.
- Toolbar can be dragged off the form.
- Piping data to application doesnt work.
- Piped data does not automatically fire selected transcoder and update output text window.
- Multi-line input results in output with an empty last line.
- Encoding > base: 'Like hex' checkbox does not work (disabled, awaiting creation of base64 implementation selector).
- Encoding > base: exception was thrown when certain illegal base64 lines where entered.
- Hard to see that textboxes are disabled. Background color should change.
- PrefixPostfixSeperator > could not handle absent seperator & present prefix/postfix. Now splitting on prefix/postfix if seperator is not there.
- First transcoder (convert) not selected on keep and clear.
- Changed font to a monospaced one. This improves readability and usability.
- Newline type was empty by default, and newline type detection does not run in corner cases (eg when using the generate transcoder).
- Newline type detection did not function properly: when the amount of DOS and Linux newlines is equal, we have DOS newlines, as the Linux newline is a subset of a DOS newline.
- Text on uuEncode and yEncode panel was not visible.
- Clipboard integration didn't work under OpenJDK.
- Zooming: needed to select input text panel to make ctrl+scroll work.
- Pressing ALT-F4 fires exit procedure twice.
- Pressing ESC when in a close window exits the complete application, but should cancel the window.
- When pressing ALT-F4, repeatedly pressing F4 results in piles of exit calls.
- Pressing ESC in tool windows will terminate the complete application.
- In text -> utilities -> newline replacement, you could only replace and delete newlines if you where not in line mode.
- Entering illegal hex values in XOR crypt key field resulted in a NumberFormatException. This is now handled correctly.
- XOR crypting did not work correctly in line mode, as the encrypted data can contain newlines. Changed to raw transcoder.
- File save: saving result text did not actually save the text.

## Technical improvements
The following technical improvements are made in this version: 
- Surrounded transcoder calls with try-except to prevent application failure on transcoder failure.
- Extracted the two main text panes to seperate files, to enable the possibility of multiple views in the future.
- Interactive ASCII table is split into the table popup and an ASCII data populator. This will speed up implementation of different tables.
- Replaced AdvancedTranscoder to RawTranscoder, where the RawTranscoder receives the complete original text, allowing transcoders to work in one go. Three transcoders currently use this: Generator (to generate once, instead of every line), Sorter (to sort everything) and Utilities (to replace newlines).

## Known bugs
- Not yet implemented: 
    - Encoding > uuEncode
    - Encoding > yEncode
    - Crypto > AES
    - Crypto > Vignere
    - Crypto > Enigma
    - Text > count
    - Text > Extract > Column and Seperator: inverse selection
- Known bugs (tolerated & ignored for now!) 
    - Need to click outside of spinners for change to take effect.
    - Type text, try to exit, press red cross or ALT-F4 to cancel exit from save dialog, after this, the first following escape will be ignored.
    - Unicode text to text decoding cannot be implemented correctly because source data to converter is supplied by string. This messes with the unicode data.
    - Unicode encoding scheme (big- or little endian) detection is done in a crappy way right now. Waiting for settings function?!
    - XOR decrypting ignores/overrides line-mode setting. This is because XOR-encrypted data can/will contain newlines.
    - The hex view is not functioning yet, working on it... Disabled for now
    - Column extractor: empty columns (returned as "") are completely ignored by controller (like null result).
    - uuEncoding: The encoding is not working (error in cryptex lib)
